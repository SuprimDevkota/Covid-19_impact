# Covid-19 Tracker

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

I started doing this project as a way of visualizing how rise in covid cases in a country affects the covid cases in it's neighbouring countries. Seeing as how Covid cases all over the world have started to rise once more, I thought I'd use this opportunity to graph how Nepal and India's cases have changed in the span of a year.
I also used annotations to label relevant indicators.

Interestingly I found that Nepal lags behind India when it comes to the peak of covid cases such that when a peak is formed in India it's effects in Nepal start manifesting weeks later which lead me to believe that Nepal has much worse to bear in the coming days.
