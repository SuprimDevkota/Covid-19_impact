I started doing this project as a way of visualizing how rise in covid cases in a country affects the covid cases in it's neighbouring countries. Seeing as how Covid cases all over
the world has started to rise once more, I thought I'd use this opportunity to graph and see how Nepal and India's cases have changed in the span of a year.
Furthermore, I used annotations to label parts which have been turning points for the covid crisis in these two countries.
Interestingly I found that Nepal lags behind India when it comes to the peak of covid cases such that when a peak is formed in India it's effects in Nepal start manifesting weeks later which lead me to believe that Nepal has much worse to bear in the coming days.
